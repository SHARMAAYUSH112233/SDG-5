<h1><font color = "black" font size ="5"><center>What are stereotypes?</center></font></h1>
<h2><font color = "navy" font size ="4"><center>In social psychology, a stereotype is a generalized belief about a particular category of people. It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group.</center></font></h2>
<ul type="square"><font color="maroon"><b>
    <li>Girls and women are generally expected to dress in typically feminine ways and be polite, accommodating, and nurturing. 
    <li>Men are generally expected to be strong, aggressive, and bold.
    <li>Many families expect to have boy and not a girl because they think that boys will help them and stay with them after the marriage.

<h1><font color ="black" font size ="5"><center>What are the solutions for these problems?</center></font></h1>
<h2><font color ="navy" font size ="4"><center>There are various ways to address gender inequality. These include increasing women's representation in leadership and decision-making, redistributing care-work and productive resources, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within companies, supporting reproductive freedom, providing access to healthcare and sex education, and stopping child marriage and sexual harassment. Additionally, making education gender-sensitive and offering flexibility and empathy in the workplace are important steps towards reducing gender inequality.</center></font></h2>
